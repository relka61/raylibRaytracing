# Raytracer

A real-time raytracer built using **Raylib** and **OpenGL 3.3 Core**.

## Features
- Ray tracing with basic primitives (spheres, quads, and more to come later)
- Realistic lighting model
- Adjustable camera and scene controls
- Optimized rendering pipeline using OpenGL shaders

## Setup
- Simply running the exe will start the raytracer
- It gathers the information about the scene by looking in the `world` folder
- There is more information provided in the `world` folder telling you how to edit it


## Controls
- `WASD` for moving around
- `EQ` for up-down movement
- `P` to pause and open the pause settings
- `T` to toggle fullscreen
- `H` to render a high quality image (only when the settings menu isn't open)

This is just a project of myn I'm working on in my free time.
My main resource for learning is from [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_]([https://raytracing.github.io)
And thanks to everyone who has worked on Raylib
I hope you enjoy messing around with my raytracer.
